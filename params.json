{"name":"Bookmarked","tagline":"A categorized list of the best sites on the web","body":"###The Basics\r\nBookmarks are a great way of keeping sites close at hand that you either use a lot or are helpful for specific tasks. Another reason to bookmark pages is to not lose things - the internet is huge, and trying to find a website can sometimes prove to be a challenge. So why not just keep lots of useful websites right at your fingertips?\r\n\r\nThis repo - [for now][#future] - contains my personal collection of bookmarks. I have collected these links from all over the place and sorted the links into different categories (E.g. [Learning][#learning] or [Music][#music]) in the intrest of simplicity and ease of navigation. Feel free to download these lists. _Please check out the [how to contribute][#contribute] section if you are interested in adding bookmarks that are not here (it is encouraged!)_\r\n\r\n###Repo Structure\r\nAs of right now, this repo is very basic in structure, partially because there is not much here yet, and partially because I am still learning the GitHub system (on this subject, if you see any mistakes I am making in my usage of GitHub, please point them out to me!) \r\n\r\nCurrently you are in the root of the repo, and you should see 3 things:\r\n\r\n1. a directory name **files**\r\n2. a file named **LICENSE**\r\n3. and the **README.md** (hint: you are currently reading this one)\r\n\r\nInside of [**files**][files] you will find the raw downloadable lists of bookmarks. There is the [**bookmarks.md**][bookmarks.md] file and [**bookmarks.html**][bookmarks.html] file. They are both the same, the only difference is the formatting. The first (bookmarks.md) is in the markdown syntax that Github uses, and bookmarks.html is simply the default HTML file that Google Chrome exports. Download them as you see fit (take a look at the [**README**][/files/readme] in the **files** directory for more info).  \r\n\r\n###Future\r\nI really don't know where this project will go. It was made on a whim, as I simply wanted to share the sites I find particularly interesting or useful with others. These are some thoughts on what I hope this might become. \r\n#####Contributing\r\nThis is meant to be a project for the community at large, so I really hope that people will contribute more links that they think would be good additions to the list. If you would like to contribute, just fork this, add your links and submit a pull request. There aren't really any limits as to what you link to, except for keeping it \"PG13\" (a.k.a appropriate, not overtly NSFW), but I do reserve the right to either remove links that I don't feel add to the list, or to refuse pull requests at my discretion. This is not to stop people from contributing, but only to make sure this doesn't become just a huge mess.\r\n\r\nBesides contributing links of your own to the list, I welcome any feedback or suggestions you have as to how I can make this better, so feel free to shoot me a message.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#future]: #future\r\n[#contribute]: #contributing\r\n[#learning]: /files/bookmarks.md#learning\r\n[#music]: /files/bookmarks.md#music\r\n[files]: /files/\r\n[bookmarks.md]: /files/bookmarks.md\r\n[bookmarks.html]: /files/bookmarks.html\r\n[/files/readme]: /files/README.md\r\n","google":"UA-39800224-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
